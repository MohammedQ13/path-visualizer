Pathfinding Visualizer is a web application built with JavaScript and React that allows users to visualize the Dijkstra's algorithm in action to find the shortest path between two nodes in a grid. Users also have the ability to create obstacles and walls.

**Technologies Used**

Pathfinding Visualizer is built using various technologies such as:

JavaScript: Used as the primary programming language for developing.

React: Used for creating the frontend web interface and managing client-side functionality.

**Features**

Dijkstra's Algorithm: Pathfinding Visualizer uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a grid.

Obstacle Creation: Users can create obstacles and walls in the grid to make the pathfinding process more challenging.

Step-by-Step Visualization: The pathfinding process can be visualized step-by-step, allowing users to see how the algorithm works.

Easy to Use: Pathfinding Visualizer's intuitive interface makes it easy to use for both novice and experienced users.

Responsive Design: Pathfinding Visualizer is designed to be responsive and can be accessed from any device with an internet connection.
Installation
